# Ramda

+ Ramda is general-purpose toolkit designed for the programmers who prefers
  functional programming style , functional programming is a programming
  paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

+ It makes creation of immutable functional pipelines easy.

# Unique features

1. Makes code look simple and elegant by providing immutable and side-effect
   free functions.

2. Ramda functions are automatically curried , allowing programmer to make new
   functions from old ones and making job easy.
   
# Installation

1. To use with **Node** :
   +  ``` $ npm install ramda ```
   +  Then in **console** :
   +  ``` const R = require('ramda'); ```

2. To use in **Deno** :
   + ``` import * as R from "https://deno.land/x/ramda@v0.27.2/mod.ts"; ```

3. To use in **Nest.land**:
   + ``` import * as R from "https://x.nest.land/ramda@0.27.2/mod.ts"; ```

4. To use directly in **Browser** :
   +  ``` <script src="path/to/yourCopyOf/ramda.js"></script> ```
   + minified version of above
   +  ``` <script src="path/to/yourCopyOf/ramda.min.js"></script> ```

## Using without installation

1. From **cdsjs** : 
    ```   <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ramda/0.25.0/ramda.min.js"></script>  ``` 

2. From **jsDelivr** :
   ``` <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ramda@0.25.0/dist/ramda.min.js"></script>```
     
   ``` <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ramda@0.25/dist/ramda.min.js"></script> ```
     
   ``` <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ramda@latest/dist/ramda.min.js"></script>```

# Naming history

        " Ok, so we like sheep. That's all. It's a short name, not already taken.
          It could as easily have been eweda, but then we would be forced to say
          eweda lamb!, and no one wants that. For non-English speakers, lambs are
          baby sheep, ewes are female sheep, and rams are male sheep. So perhaps
          ramda is a grown-up lambda... but probably not. " ~ creator  

# Checking performance -> Testing

## What is a Test Suite?

   + It is a contianer with set of tests helping testers executing and
     reporting the performances.
   + Test suites are created based on the cycle or scope of program with
     multiple test cases.
   + Any test takes state from one of these: `Active` , `Inprogress` & `Completed`.

## Testing

### On Console:

   + To run the test suite from the console, have mocha needs to be installed:
     ``` npm install -g mocha ```
     
   + Then from the root of the project, you can just call
     ``` mocha ```

   + Alternately, if you've installed the dependencies, via:
     ``` npm install ```
     then you can run the tests (and get detailed output) by running:
     ``` npm test ```

### On Browser

   + You can use **testem** to test across different browsers (or even
     headlessly), with livereloading of tests.

   + Install testem ```(npm install -g testem)``` and run testem. Open the link      provided in your browser and you will see the results in your terminal.

   + If you have ```PhantomJS installed```, you can ```run testem -l phantomjs```  to run the tests completely headlessly.

# Usage

   + For v0.25 and up, import the whole library or pick ES modules directly from the library:

    import * as R from 'ramda'

    const {identity} = R
    R.map(identity, [1, 2, 3])

   + Destructuring imports from ramda does not necessarily prevent importing the entire library. You can manually cherry-pick methods like the following,
     which would only grab the parts necessary for identity to work
     ```import identity from 'ramda/src/identity' identity()```

   + Manually cherry picking methods is cumbersome, however. Most bundlers like      Webpack and Rollup offer tree-shaking as a way to drop unused Ramda code
     and reduce bundle size, but their performance varies, discussed here.

   + Here is a summary of the optimal setup based on what technology you are
